<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>

Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning, where the goal is to predict the class of an input data point based on its features. Decision trees are a popular and intuitive method for classification, widely used in many applications. A decision tree is a tree-like model that breaks down a dataset into smaller subsets by considering a sequence of decisions based on the features of the data. The nodes in the tree represent decisions, and the edges represent the possible outcomes of these decisions. Decision trees are easy to understand, interpret, and visualize, making them a popular choice for many applications where model transparency is important. In this context, this article will explore the concept of classification using decision trees, the process involved in building a decision tree, and the advantages and limitations of decision tree classification.

<h2> OBJECTIVE </h2>

**Perform Classification using Decision Trees. Demonstrate Multiple Datasets, do the necessary EDA and show various evaluation metrics.**



<h2> CONCLUSION </h2>
In conclusion, the decision tree classification algorithm is a powerful tool for predicting the class of an unknown instance based on a set of features. With its intuitive visual representation and ability to handle both categorical and numerical data, decision trees have proven to be an effective and popular machine learning technique.In this project, we have explored the use of decision trees for classification by building a model to predict the class of a dataset. We have used various techniques such as cross-validation to ensure that our model is not overfitting and hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance.

Through our experimentation and analysis, we have demonstrated that decision tree classification is a valuable technique that can provide accurate predictions for a wide range of applications. With further research and refinement, decision trees have the potential to become an even more powerful tool for data analysis and decision-making.
